        In the most basic of terms I`m a forty-one year old human, a walking amalgamation of various jobs, life experiences, traumas and challenges. 
        I`ve built houses, saved a few lives, climbed mountains, walked a section of the Great Wall of China, lost nearly everything, gained what was 
        important back, and about a million other things of varying importance and impact on who I am at this very moment. Making the decision to leave 
        a job I had been doing for nearly a decade was tough, but I felt like it was time for a change and to do something both radically different and 
        also slightly familiar to me. I remember my then ninety-five year old great-grandfather telling me as a teenager that I should “do something 
        with that computer you`re always fooling with”, and now, nearly thirty years later, I finally am. I see this as an opportunity, not just on 
        account of the financial allure of the industry, but as one to continue to learn and evolve as a programmer and creator. Wherever I find myself 
        landing in the field, I know that I will have the chance on a daily basis to resolve issues and develop both myself and whatever product or 
        project I am currently working on. You are looking at what I know will be the first of many.</p>

        Oh, you just wanted to know who I am as a person? Not anything too fancy. Outside of class, I am a musician, an avid film fan, and an occasional 
        podcast guest. I`ve been called a “metal hippie”, which is a rather accurate descriptor. My partner and I both work on a small urban farm in the 
        same community where we live, doing our part to address food insecurity amongst the cities` residents. We live in a tiny gray house with purple doors
        and shutters with three 
        spoiled cats. I have lots of tattoos, several piercings, and only wear black clothing because it makes me feel invisible and safe. I like taking 
        things apart and fixing them, and can build most anything I put my mind to. Being outside makes me the happiest. If I were an animal, I'd 
        absolutely be a raccoon. I un-ironically love all things `Hello Kitty` and Sanrio-adjacent.
